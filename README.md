Collection of Computational Physics Programs, Materials and References.

COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

AIM:

1. Numerical computation using a Programming language (Python selected).
2. Root of an equation, numerical differentiation and integration.
3. Solving selected problems in classical and quantum physics numerically.
4. Differential equations and linear algebra numerical solutions.
5. Solving classical statistical mechanics problem using Monte Carlo simulations.

TO DO:

1. Make a detailed plan regarding what all problems are to be used to tech each computational method.
2. Compile a github repository with clear catagorizing of topics, methods, codes and useful references.
3. Make sure all codes are working clearly.
4. Review the youtube videos we found.
5. RK vs Verlett
6. Lattice of finite wells (Kreonig-Penny model?)
7. Try DeepNote to share jupyter notebooks.
